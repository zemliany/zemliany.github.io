Greetings to everyone who reach out this page! My name is Maksym based on Ukraine, and I've been working as DevOps / SRE / Platform Engineer. I started my career in IT as a IT Service Engineer in 2012. Worked and gained experience mainly in product companies, which allowed me to gradually grow into DevOps. Starting from 2024, I've entered into Master's Machine Learning and Cloud Computing program at [SET University](https://www.setuniversity.edu.ua/en/education/computer-science-machine-learning-cloud-computing/)

In my work I've mainly focused and specialized on full-cycle automation, clouds, administration, containers management and orchestration.
In my Master's degree study, I'm hoping to achieve some new exciting experience with Machine Learning and generally learn something new

I love to learn something new and share experiences. There are some interesting (or not) notes will be appeared here in scope of gained my professional or study experience or experince of my collegues (from their approval of course), where I was participated as contributor.

There is no any guarantee that any notes or articles will appear here regularly, but at the same time, perhaps someone will find something useful for themselves as a starting point for research or another transit point in an attempt to solve a specific problem.
